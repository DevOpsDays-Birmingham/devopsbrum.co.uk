All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any DevOps Birmingham meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout any events and online communications related to DevOps Birmingham.

## ANTI HARASSMENT POLICY

DevOps Birmingham is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, including talks. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup and future meetups.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Organisers and helpers (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup and future meetups.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organiser immediately.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetups, all DevOps Birmingham related social events and on all online communication platforms related to DevOps Birmingham.
